The Smog is composed of 3 elements:
1.The Volume material that has to be applied to a box to create a dynamic volumetric cloud fog
2.The Post Process material that has to be applied to a post process volume to create the around fog
3.The height fog (which is part of the UE lighting system). The height fog needs to have "Volumetric fog" ticked in order for the smog to function properly
